Aptitune is a simple app that broadens your horizons and tests your knowledge of musical artists by playing sample clips and posing three trivia questions per track. You can focus your musical exploration by selecting your preferred genres, and you can even add tracks you love to your Listen List.

###How To Play

1. Click Start Quiz to test your knowledge of any music genre. Or else log in and choose your genre preferences in Dashboard  Genres / Profile.

2. For each track, you will be asked to name the artist, album, and track title.

3. After each quiz, you can save the song to your favorites, stored in Dashboard Listen List. Or just skip to the next one.

   Check the Leaderboards to compare yourself to the top-ranked players. Or login through Facebook and compare yourself to your friends in Dashboard  Friends.

  For each correct answer, you gain three trophies. But be carefulâ€”for each incorrect guess, you also lose one!

##Developers

Aptitune was developed by Patrick Eldridge, Bennett Lin, Allie Moses, and Daniel Smith, students of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.

##Version

1.0.0

##Tech

Aptitune was built with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, iTunes API, D3, PostgreSQL, jQuery, JavaScript, iCheck plug-in, Facebook OAuth, Bcrypt.

##Challenges

The biggest challenge was coming up with an idea; our group wanted to create an app about which we felt passionately. Eventually, Aptitune came to fruition. We are all very pleased with the concept and outcome and feel proudly to show this creation in our portfolios.

Some other challenges were ensuring that the finalized Heroku version worked correctly, switching from the Spotify API to iTunes during the final stage of our project, and deciding on some of the more minute design decisions.
